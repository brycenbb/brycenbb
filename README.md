Hi I'm Brycen, an East Midlands based education researcher turned aspiring full-stack developer through School of Code
as I work towards my dream goal of working in EdTech!

As part of my journey with School of Code in April I am documenting my experience learning full-stack content in a directed environment.
To prepare for this, I have been self teaching using The Odin Project as a base since early February 2022. 

I am commiting to #100DaysOfCode (working days for me ðŸ˜„) as part of documenting my experience! I will simply move down each idea and any accompanying
thoughts as I move through this challenge and School of Code:

  Apr 18th - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with APIs for the first time!
